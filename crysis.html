Crysis is a ﬁrst-person shooter video game series developed by German developer Crytek and published by Electronic Arts. The series revolves around a group of military protagonists with "nanosuits", technologically advanced suits of armor that allow them to gain enhanced physical strength, speed, defense, and cloaking abilities. The protagonists face off against hostile North Korean soldiers, heavily armed mercenaries, and a race of
technologically advanced aliens known as the Ceph, who arrived on Earth millions of years ago for unclear reasons, and have recently been awakened.

Common game play elements
<br><br>
Characters in Crysis use nanosuits, advanced powered exoskeletons developed by the military that grant them special abilities. "Maximum Armor" enhances the suit's ability to withstand bullet and shrapnel impacts, "Maximum Strength" greatly enhances the wearer's physical strength, to the point of being able to punch cars through the air; and Common gameplay elements
"Maximum Speed" allows the wearer to run and act extremely fast. "Cloak" activates the suit's cloaking device that makes the user near-invisible.
The ﬁrst two games, Crysis and Crysis Warhead, take place in 2020 on the ﬁctional Lingshan Islands, off the Philippines. The protagonists of both games both belong to "Raptor Team," a United States special forces operation that is sent to the island to investigate aggressive behavior by North Korea. The player uses various weapons, including traditional projectile weapons like handguns, submachine guns, assault
riﬂes, and sniper riﬂes (all of which can be modiﬁed with scopes and attachments in real time), as well as explosives and the nanosuit's natural abilities. Multiplayer gameplay modes introduce ﬁctional futuristic weapons based on the ice technology introduced by the alien antagonists who reside on the island. In single-player, Raptor Team faces off against both the North Korean military and these alien foes.
Crysis 2, the sequel to the original game, takes place in 2023 in New York City, where characters from the previous games appear or are mentioned, but the
protagonist is a new character, a US Marine named Alcatraz. The nanosuit in the game (dubbed "Nanosuit 2") is a streamlined version of the original, without separate "strength" and "speed" modes, rather performing context-sensitive acts of enhanced strength or agility, although it retains the separate "armour" and "stealth" modes.
