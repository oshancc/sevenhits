"For You" is a song co-written and recorded by Australian country music singer Keith Urban. It is included on Act of Valor: The Album, and plays over the closing credits to the ﬁlm Act of Valor. It was released as a single in April 2012. The song was nominated at the 70th Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.

The song is about the sacriﬁces made by soldiers. The single was certiﬁed Gold in the USA in early February 2013. Urban said in a statement (reported by The Boot) that he and Monty Powell were inspired to write the song after seeing Act of Valor, and that he "wanted to capture the essence of not only what these men and women do so extraordinarily, but how that relates to all of us." All proceeds from the single are donated to the Navy SEAL Foundation.
