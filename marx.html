Richard Noel Marx (born September 16, 1963) is an American adult contemporary and pop/rock singer, songwriter, musician and record producer who has sold over 30 million records. He had a stream of hit singles in the late 1980s and 1990s, including "Endless Summer Nights", "Right Here Waiting", "Now and Forever", "Hazard" and "At the Beginning" with Donna Lewis. Although some of his major hit songs were ballads, many of his songs have had
a classic rock style, such as "Don't Mean Nothing", "Should've Known Better", "Satisﬁed", and "Too Late to Say Goodbye".
<br><br>
Marx placed himself in the record books by being the ﬁrst solo artist to have his ﬁrst seven singles hit the Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4). His record sales worldwide exceed 30 million. He has also written or collaborated on songs with other artists such as "This I Promise You" by NSYNC and "Dance with My Father" by Luther Vandross. The latter song won several Grammy Awards. His 14th and latest chart-topper, "Long Hot Summer", performed by Keith Urban, gave Marx the distinction of having a song he wrote or co-wrote top the charts in four different decades.
<br><br>
Marx was born in Chicago, Illinois, the only child of Ruth (née Guildoo), a former singer, and Dick Marx, a jazz musician and founder of a successful jingle company in the early 1960s. He attended North Shore Country Day School. He has three halfsiblings from his father's previous marriage.
<br><br>
Marx began his career in music at the age of 5, singing commercial jingles written by his father's company; its list of advertising hits includes Arm & Hammer, Ken-L Ration and Nestlé Crunch.
Marx was 17 and living in Highland Park, Illinois when a tape of his songs ended up in the hands of Lionel Richie. Richie thought Marx had the talent and told the teen, "I can't promise you anything, but you should come to L.A." After graduating from North Shore Country Day School in 1981, Marx moved to Los Angeles and visited Richie.
Marx initially sang backing vocals for various artists, and also had a minor acting role in the television movie Coach Of The Year, which starred Robert Conrad. He was singing for Kenny Rogers in 1984 when he overheard Rogers say he needed a new song. Within days, Marx gave him the demo of "Crazy." Rogers recorded it, along with another of Marx’s songs, "What About Me?" This also featured James Ingram and Kim Carnes. The trio recording hit #1 Adult Contemporary and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 (while just scraping onto the Country and R&B charts) in late 1984 while "Crazy" hit #1 Country and #5 AC the following year. Soon after, Marx began working with producer David Foster and writing songs for the group Chicago and R&B singer Freddie Jackson.
While working as a songwriter and doing background vocals, Marx continued to pursue his own record deal. His demo tape was rejected by every label in Hollywood until, ﬁnally, four years after moving to Los Angeles, the president of EMI/Manhattan Records, Bruce Lundvall, signed him. Marx contacted his friend Fee Waybill, frontman of The Tubes, and some other musicians, including Joe Walsh, and Randy Meisner of the Eagles, to create a ten-track debut album.
<br><br>
Debut album <br><br>
Marx's self-titled debut album, released in June 1987, yielded four hit singles and sold nearly four million copies in the US. The debut single, "Don't Mean Nothing," about the potential pitfalls of the music business, had been released the previous month, and it climbed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #1 on Billboard's Album Rock charts. Marx became the ﬁrst new artist played on 117 radio stations nationwide during his initial week on the charts. The next two singles, "Should’ve Known Better" and "Endless Summer Nights" reached #3 and #2, respectively. The fourth single release,
"Hold On to the Nights," earned Marx his ﬁrst #1 Pop single.
With the success of his self-titled album, he embarked on his ﬁrst world tour, initially opening for REO Speedwagon, but quickly began headlining his own shows. His ﬁrst tour kept him on the road for 14 months.
In 1988, Marx was nominated for a Grammy Award for 'Best Rock Vocal Performance - Solo' for "Don’t Mean Nothing."
